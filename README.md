# AIProj

## Description
This project will load in a obj file (3d model) then generate various infill patterns at various densities. These newly created object files will be passed into a simulator that will mock 3d print them. The simulator will go purposely deviate from the correct direction every once in a while. The strength of the defect and surrounding areas will be tested in a method described in this paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352431617301256 and then determine what correction will need to be made if any
